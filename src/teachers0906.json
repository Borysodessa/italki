          "teaching_style": "As I previously mentioned, I always adapt to the needs of my students. If you want to focus on just passing an exam, we will make our strategies together to achieve that goal. If you want to study for an international language test, we will focus on hacking the test and essential tips to get a better grade.\nAnd I know that learning a language is not just about passing an exam, that's why we can have conversational classes, during which we just choose an interesting topic and talk about it during class and I will not interrupt you, so you can improve your fluency and at the end of the class I will show you some sentences which you said and we will work on getting rid of some common mistakes.",

          "introduction": "Do you need to take your business English to the next level? \nAre you preparing for an important interview or presentation?\nDo you want to sound more professional and improve your career opportunities? \n\nI have been teaching English to professionals like yourself for 6 years as my full time job, helping them with problems like those listed above. \n\nIn our lessons we will focus specifically on your own PERSONAL GOALS, using a range of materials to suit your particular learning style - just as I did with Jakub... 'When I started lessons 3 years ago I set David a challenge. I wanted him to make my lessons dependent on my skills and how my skills will grow. He adapts his style to my needs, and I feel much more confident with my English in present days.' Jakub Jedlicka, Managing Director, Casablanca Inc. \n\nIn order to focus on your needs, I will give you a comprehensive assessment of your level during the trial lesson, so that I can tell you exactly where you are with your Business English, and the areas that we can improve to take it to the next level. Then we will discuss you own personal aims with English, which I will use to make a course just for you. I also make sure we cover all core business topics, themes for discussion and important areas of business vocabulary. \n\nI have a full Oxford TEFL certification and I have taught hundreds of students from all over the world since 2011. I hope I can use my experience to help you. \n\nI look forward to meeting you so that we can set some specific goals to take your business English forward! \n\n'David’s lessons provide everything for my personal improvement. We are not rigidly linked to one specific textbook or topic, and that’s great for me. I enjoy lessons, David is the best teacher I ever had' - Martin Nosek, HR Manager.\n\nCancellation Policy - Lessons cancelled within 24 hours of the scheduled time will be charged at the full rate.  For students with packages, students will be refunded 1 late cancellation every 6 months.",

If this sounds like your situation, I would love to hear from you and demonstrate how I can help you level up your English quickly.\n\nDuring my 12 years of discussing business in-depth across a wide range of fields, I have collected a huge amount of data on vocabulary, idioms and phrasal verbs that my students really need based on real discussion.",

Моя история началась с репетиторства для детей, но вскоре я осознала, что педагогика - это именно мой путь. Зараз у мене налічується значний досвід роботи зі студентами різного віку, від 5 до 75 років, з різним рівнем знань.\n\nMy journey started with students who spoke no Russian, Ukrainian, or English. To bridge the language gap, I turned to engaging games and vivid visuals. Currently based in Slovakia, I've added Slovak to my toolkit for even more effective communication. Whether you're a curious child or an adult eager to explore Ukrainian or Russian, I'm here to guide you.",

Давайте розмовляти! \n\nВикористовую комунікативні методики (розмова на різні теми, role-plays - розіграш певних ситуацій тощо) для подолання мовного бар'єру. \n\nWe'll read and discuss some topics due to your level and interests. Do you like philosophy? Literature? Art? No problem! We'll discuss it.\n\nДля збільшення словникового запасу використовую підручники загального типу, які підбираю під кожного учня індивідуально.  \n\nПри смешанном уровне (например, между Elementary и Pre-Intermediate) делаю комбинацию из нескольких учебников.\n\nWe'll learn some new words and work with them in games, videos, games - whatever can help you to remember them for ages!",

Мы изучаем грамматику с помощью видеороликов со смешными хомячками и играми, такими как «попади по кроту» или «колесо фортуны».
